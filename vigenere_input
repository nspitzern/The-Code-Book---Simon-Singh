EMILY
sit thee down, and have no shame,
cheek by jowl, and knee by knee:
what care i for any name?
what for order or degree?

let me screw three up a peg:
let me loose thy tounge with wine:
callest thou that thing a leg?
which is thinnest? thine or mine?

thou shalt not be saved by works:
thou hast been a sinner too:
ruined trunks on withed forks,
empty scarecrows, i and you!

fill the cup, and fill the can:
have a rouse before the morn:
every moment dies a man,
every moment one is born.
